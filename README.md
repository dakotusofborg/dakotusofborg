```

I build systems from the metal up.  
My work focuses on **real-time architecture, custom memory strategies, CPU-level optimization, and engine-grade C++ development**.

Right now, I’m executing a **12-week C++ Carmack Sprint** — a deliberate systems gauntlet built to sharpen memory intuition, concurrency control, and performance reasoning.

This is not a tutorial journey.  
This is the engineering track.

## **👤 Professional Tagline**
**C++ Systems Engineer | Data-Oriented Design | Engine Architecture | Low-Level Optimization**  
I specialize in building **infrastructure**, not demos — vector implementations, allocators, CPU rasterizers, ECS pipelines, and low-level tools that demand correctness and speed.

# **🔥 The Carmack Sprint — 12-Week Systems Program**
A sequence of **12 standalone systems repos**, each tackling a core discipline:

- Vector implementation & RAII discipline  
- Resource ownership & move-only types  
- STL internals & cache-aware programming  
- Header-only math library (constexpr/SIMD)  
- Lock-free ring buffer (MPMC)  
- Profiling & low-level optimization  
- Custom allocators (stack/linear/pool)  
- Entity Component System architecture  
- CPU software rasterizer  
- Memory, concurrency & UB debugging lab  
- Unreal Engine subsystem engineering  
- Final integrated mini-engine (capstone)

All projects include:

- Design docs  
- Benchmarks  
- Profiling data  
- Debugging logs  
- Weekly postmortems  
- Portfolio-level code quality

# **⚙️ Engineering Principles**
### **1. Complexity is leverage**  
Anything painful — allocators, cache behavior, atomics — is worth mastering.

### **2. If it isn’t measured, it doesn’t exist**  
Every module includes **benchmarks** and **profiling artifacts**.

### **3. Architecture > Code**  
Clear mental models, then implementation.

### **4. Logs > Excuses**  
Every unexpected behavior gets documented.

### **5. Systems over tutorials**  
I build from scratch. No cargo-culting.
